an anti-NSFW software


*purpose*
  The intention of this software is to provide a more
effective anti-pornography software by any means nessary.


*methods*
  The current methods of acomplishing this goal contains 3 
main parts. 

-collect- take screenshot of current activity
-analyze- analyze screenshot to check if the user has NSFW content on their screen
-action- take action if porn is detected


  -collect-
      use a system call to take a screenshot and save it
     to a temporary location every so often.
  
  -analyze-
      use a small locally run analyzing software to 
    take the screenshot and determing porn/not porn
    
  -action-
      use some sort of deterrent/punishment after detection
    of pornogrophy. This includes but is not limited to 
    one or more of the following:
    
    -crashing the operating system
    -displaying a splash screen (one that scolds the user)
    -notifying a list of contacts that you were doing this
 
I do not currently have the knowledge or skill to pull something
of this complexity off however I thought it would test my skills
and build something of use to society along the way.
